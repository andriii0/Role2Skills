To achieve this, we're developing new types of metrics, improving ML, and implementing new sources and formats for interacting with them.

We expect you to:
• Have more than two years of experience in product analytics or development
• Have experience working with data in Python
• Have knowledge of mathematics and mathematical statistics

What you need to do:
• Understand the parameters of a good search query for recommendations, reflect this in metrics and improvement ideas
• Develop recommendation base creation processes
• Improve ranking algorithms (e.g., using cool source-related features)

It would be a plus if you:
• Experience working with text data
• Implemented ML cases in production
• Experience developing product metrics

Our main goal is to use algorithms and mathematics to reduce the cost and speed up warehouse processes to improve the user experience. We use Java 8/11, Spring, Spring Boot, MS SQL, Gradle, Git, JUnit, DbUnit, BitBucket, and Linux.

We expect you to:
• be proficient in and have experience with Java SE 8+
• be familiar with machine learning and optimization algorithms

What you'll need to do:
• develop and implement algorithms to speed up order picking in warehouses (Java, WMS)
• improve tools and solutions for automating warehouse processes (Java, WMS)
• implement data collection processes for analytics and model training (MS SQL, YT)

If you're interested in developing modern, high-load backend services, love and know how to work with data, are interested in Big Data, machine learning, and NLP, have a passion for infrastructure development, enjoy cloud platforms, or have simply dreamed of working in online advertising, come and talk.

We expect you to:
• have a strong knowledge of algorithms and data structures
• be proficient in C++
• understand the structure of web services
• have at least two years of experience
• be willing to work in a team

What you'll need to do:
• solve research, engineering, and product problems (building a real-time ad generation service; building a fast data warehouse for advertising materials; mining useful website information—products, their characteristics, and images; generating consistent ad text using neural networks; ranking banners; stream processing of Big Data, and much more)

It would be a plus if you:
• have basic Linux skills
• know Python
• know MapReduce technology
• are familiar with machine learning
• have DevOps skills
